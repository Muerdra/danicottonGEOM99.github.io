<h1>ESRI StoryMaps Beta</h1> 

	<h2> New this year to StoryMaps is the guided tour! </h2> 

		<p> 
		The guided tour is a brand-new release from ESRI as of January 2020 with two different layouts to choose from. First is the Guided Tour Media focused, as simple as it sounds the majority of the screen goes to highlighting media with a small focus on the map itself. The map focused tour highlights the map, dedicating a large part of the screen to allow for more points to be visible and examined. There is a small section for text and even a few pictures! 

	ESRI allows you to flip between the layouts to determine which is the best for you. 

	Even better now you can have multiple layouts in one story! You can use the Sidecar, then have the Map Focused Guided tour, add in a slideshow. This is all on a continuous scroll however and could disrupt the flow of the text so use wisely! 

	In addition to the new map forms I.e Sidecar, Slideshow, and Guided tours, you can add in quotations, buttons, imbed links, videos and images! The new release is truly innovative.
